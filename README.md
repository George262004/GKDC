# GKDC – Go-Kart Design Challenge (Electric Powertrain)

This repository contains the code and schematics used in the **Go-Kart Design Challenge (GKDC)** powered by **ISNEE Motorsports**. We participated as part of the Electric Department (Powertrain), responsible for the electrical systems in our custom-built electric go-kart.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Our electric powertrain system was designed to efficiently manage both **high-voltage (HV)** and **low-voltage (LV)** circuits, enabling safe and effective control of an 11000W BLDC motor. The system used an Arduino Nano to manage power logic, switching, and safety.

## ⚙️ Hardware Used

- **Battery System:**
  - LV: 14V Lithium Iron (LiFe) battery (4S configuration)
  - HV: Two 72V 24Ah LiFePO₄ batteries connected in parallel

- **Motor:**
  - 11000W BLDC motor

- **Microcontroller:**
  - Arduino Nano

- **Other Components:**
  - Buck Converter (for voltage step-down)
  - Contactors (HV control via LV switching)
  - Motor Controller

## 💻 Software & Tools

- **Programming Language:** C/C++
- **IDE:** Arduino IDE
- **Schematic Tool:** EasyEDA
